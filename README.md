# Snake_with_cpp

**Snake!!**

Play Snake in the terminal built with sfml and c++!

## Installation

Depends on SFML. If you are running on Mac, you will need everything except the linux directory. If you're running on Linux, everything you need should
be in the Linux directory. To run the project on Linux, just navigate to this repository and run `make` in your terminal. Run the app using
`./snake-app.out` while in the repository directory.
